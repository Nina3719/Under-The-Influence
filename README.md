## Description

Substance abuse, specifically alcohol abuse, has been a severe global problem and millions of people die from it each year. This pattern of dangerous use of alcohol for mood-altering purposes can lead to dependency and physical harm and has led to countless family tragedies. Using research data and stories, not only will the project illustrate the graveness of the issue through different lenses and perspectives, but also illuminate the audience with useful counter measurements and knowledge. 

We hope this project could raise awareness on this detrimental global issue in historical, contemporary, and covid-19 context and empower the audience with information and data.
